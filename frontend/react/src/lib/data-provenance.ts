/**
 * Data provenance — the one place that says what is real and what is modelled.
 *
 * Outlier pulls live player data from ESPN's public API. Everything
 * ESPN publishes is real: names, teams, positions, injuries, season averages,
 * live games, headshots.
 *
 * DraftKings DOES publish salaries and projections. The app reads them from
 * a DraftKings slate, and every player who has one carries that real price.
 *
 * Where a price is missing, the salary field stays EMPTY — it says Pending.
 * The modelled price, if there is one, lives in its own field
 * (salary_estimate) and its own column, which the user can hide with one
 * click. It never reaches the solver and never appears on a lineup.
 *
 * Ownership is not modelled at all. Real ownership comes from DraftKings
 * contest entry data; until that exists, there is no ownership figure and
 * nothing that depends on one.
 *
 * This module exists so that "what is real?" has exactly one answer, and that
 * answer is visible to the customer rather than buried in a source file.
